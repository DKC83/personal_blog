    <h1>"If I spoke to others like I speak to myself, I'd have no mates..."</h1>
    <p>This was something that one of my coaching clients said this week after I replayed to them some of the things they said about themselves during our session, and it got me thinking...</p>
    <p>It's amazing how critical we can be of ourselves and our inner voice can sometimes be the only thing we hear. Often times, it is the things that we tell ourselves that hold us back most and push our resilience to the limits. Some of the things that I ahve found my inner critic throwing at me include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You can't do that Darren, you're not good enough.</li>
        <li>They're all going to think you're stupid for saying this.</li>
        <li>You don't belong here Darren, they're all better than you.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now can you imagine yourself saying these things to your best friend or your child? I certainly couldn't! But when it comes to ourselves, we go in swinging without a care in the world for the collateral damage we can cause.</p>
    <p>Instead, we should be aiming for self-compassion. Being kind to ourselves and finding the words that we speak so easily to our loved ones, when they're finding things difficult. Let's be honest though, it's hard!</p>
    <p>When we're deep in the weeds of self-doubt, pressure and our fight or flight response, self-compassion hides itself in a cave somewhere waiting for the coast to be clear. So, to make life a little easier, here are some ideas that can help depending on your needs at the time:</p>
    <p>Safe to say that a lot of these are things that we already know about, but do we do them when we need to? Next time you find yourself being a little harsh to yourself, why not try one of these out and see if it helps you find a least a little bit of that self-compassion?</p>
